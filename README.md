  <b>toychain</b>
</h1>

toychain is a very simplistic blockchain node modeling in Python.
While the code is my own adaptation, the implementation and architecture is from the very good [tutorial]{target=_blank} by Daniel van Flymen.
This adaptation uses [FastAPI]{target=_blank} as a web framework, and [uvicorn]{target=_blank} as ASGI server instead of the `Flask` app from van Flymen's tutorial.
